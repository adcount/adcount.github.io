### Aditya Nair, John Thundyil, Lim Kah Leong<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

AdCount is a program within *Mathematica* Version 10.3 <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> for the automated analysis of Lipid Droplets in two dimensional confocal microscope images. Created for the biologist, it features an easy to use user interface and can give robust results without extensive domain knowledge in image processing.

It is currently in beta

## Downloading AdCount

> LipoCount can be downloaded from the following Git repository: [AdCount-Git](https://gitlab.com/adityanair/LipoCount)

> It may also be used here

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/plugin/v2.1/cdfplugin.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
var cdf = new cdfplugin();
cdf.embed('AdCount_HTML.cdf', 500, 500);
</script>

## Using AdCount

>LipoCount takes in two dimensional fluorescence microscopy images of lipid droplets and estimates the nuclei count and the total area occupied by lipid droplets in each image to compute the average lipid droplet area per nuclei in an image.

To operate AdCount

- Select the `Initialize` command in the `Menu` option

- Select the image you wish to analyse following the drop down options within `Menu`

- Perform your required analysis using the `Analyse Lipid Droplets` and `Analyse Nuclei` options

- Display the results and a comparison of the original and segmented images using the `Display Result` option

- Results can be exported into an Excel file format using the `Export Results` drop down menu

## More on AdCount
